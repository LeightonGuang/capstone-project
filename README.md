# Project Title

## Overview

<!-- What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences. -->

My app does price comparions for shops with in stock items. It tells you prices of the the products and shops around you that has it.

### Problem

<!-- Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons. -->

It is hard to compare prices espeically when its a in person shop. People would like to buy something the same day instead of waiting for something to be shipped.

### User Profile

<!-- Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account. -->

People around the world who are trying to find the cheapest shop for the product that is in stock. The app will be mostly be used on a phone because they will be outside while using it.

### Features

<!-- List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented. -->

- A database to store all the products
- dark mode / light mode
- login
- google map shows the shops
- product price chart

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.
